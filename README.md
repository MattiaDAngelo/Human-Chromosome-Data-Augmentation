# Human Chromosome Data Augmentation

This repository contains the data augmentation and straightening techniques I implemented for the research paper:

[Deep-Learning-Based Human Chromosome Classification: Data Augmentation and Ensemble](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/14/7/389), 
by **Mattia D'Angelo, Loris Nanni**.

The authors of the original techniques are properly cited in the paper; I provided an implementation in the MATLAB environment, improving the algorithms for the dataset used in our study.
