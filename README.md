# Human Chromosome Data Augmentation

This repository contains the data augmentation and straightening techniques I implemented for the research paper:

NOME LINK PAPER, by **Mattia D'Angelo, Loris Nanni**.

The authors of the techniques are properly cited in the paper; I provided an implementation in the MATLAB environment, improving the algorithms for the dataset used in our study.
